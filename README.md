How to run code:
- Go to the directory of the code and photos
- To run using an input photo, enter: python3 face_blur.py theNameOfThePhoto.png
- To run using your webcam, enter: python3 face_blur.py live
  * Running this program live will most likely request your computer for camera permissions, so if you do not accept fast enough, the program will crash

- To quit after the photo is displayed, hit any key
- To quit the live video feed, enter: q
