# comp4102FinalProject
My COMP4102 Final Project for Winter 2021

How to run code:
- Go to the directory of the code and photos
- To run using an input photo, enter: python3 face_blur.py theNameOfThePhoto.png
- To run using your webcam, enter: python3 face_blur.py live
  * Running this program live will most likely request your computer for camera permissions, so if you do not accept fast enough, the program will crash
  * Once the user has given the program webcam permissions, the live portion of the program will run smoothly

- To quit after the blurred photo is displayed, hit any key
  * If this doesn't work, click the blurred image, then enter any key

- To quit the live video feed, enter: q
  * If this doesn't work, click the live video window, then enter: q
